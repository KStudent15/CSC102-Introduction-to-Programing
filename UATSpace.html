    story of our craps game
    At least 3-4 sentences
    The society that this space launch happens in is a very suppersitious society that relys on lucky numbers in their daily lives.
    Therefor for every space launch they play craps and if they get 7 or more Craps they cancel the ship launch.
    Since they didnt want to waste money on broadcasting the craps rolls they decided to include it on their webpage with the countdown so as to save money. 
    The by product is that the population now uses it to gamble but such is life.
